# Battleship Game - Java GUI

## Game Description
Battleship is a classic two-player board game where players take turns attacking the opponent's grid, trying to hit their ships. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## Game Rules
- Playe 1 starts the game, and players alternate turns.
- Each player has a grid where they have had their ships placed (e.g., carrier, battleship, cruiser, destroyer, and submarine).
- During each turn, a player will select a cell on the opponent's grid to attack.
- The opponent’s grid will show red for a miss and green for a hit.
  - If a ship is hit, an explosion effect will show on the cell.
- The game continues until all ships of one player are sunk.

## Interface Instructions

### Gameplay
- After ships are placed, players take turns attacking.
- Click on a cell on the opponent’s grid to make an attack.
- After each turn, the boards will hide and player is prompted to then switch turns.
